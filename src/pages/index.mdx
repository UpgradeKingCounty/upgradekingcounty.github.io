Internet must be a public utility to ensure we can provide equitable access for all.

> For Seattle to remain one of the leaders of technological innovation, we need more

> private Internet service providers has failed to reach everyone in the city, leaving
> 93,000 people without home Internet access. The biggest hurdle is price, 80% of

## What is Municipal Broadband?

Municpal broadband is a community-owned public internet utility. Just like how Seattle
owns and operates Seattle City Light, our electricity provider, a municipal broadband
provider would be owned and operated by the county.

As a public utility, the Internet network would be accoutable by our community, and
while private Interet Service Providers (ISPs) are able to pick and choose which areas
to provide service, a municipal utility would provide service to every resident of
county.
