# Upgrade King County

Internet must be a public utility to ensure we can provide equitable access for all.

> "For Seattle to remain one of the leaders of technological innovation, we need more
> competition and consumer options when it comes to broadband. The current market of
> private Internet service providers has failed to reach everyone in the city, leaving
> 93,000 people without home Internet access. The biggest hurdle is price, 80% of
> Seattle residents say the Internet is essential, but only 30% indicate it is
> affordable."

> Councilmember Rob Johnson, Seattle City Council District 4

## What is Municipal Broadband?

Municpal broadband is a community-owned public internet utility. Just like how Seattle
owns and operates Seattle City Light, our electricity provider, a municipal broadband
provider would be owned and operated by the county.

As a public utility, the Internet network would be accoutable by our community, and
while private Interet Service Providers (ISPs) are able to pick and choose which areas
to provide service, a municipal utility would provide service to every resident of
county.

## What Can I Do?

There are a number of things you can do to help support municipal broadband and digital
equity in King County.
