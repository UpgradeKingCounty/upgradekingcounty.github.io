## Who We Are

Upgrade King County is a new working group that meets every other Thursday.
We are focused on digital equity, municipal broadband advocacy and connecting to people
across Washington State working on helping people to get online.

We aim to build off the incredible work started by
[Upgrade Seattle](https://www.upgradeseattle.com/).

**Upgrade King County is a working group of Share The Cities.** Share The Cities is a land use education and advocacy organizing collective with
[quarterly workshops](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/share-the-cities-17542068896), a
Slack organization, and a
[monthly newsletter](https://us19.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=f592b9b46757867586bd5f9a2&id=76a04c8787).

Outside of Upgrade King County, many others are supporting this work with expert
knowledge, mentorship, and more!
